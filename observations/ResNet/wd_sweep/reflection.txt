Changing the seed from 1 to 0 resulted in the dramatic improvement of trial 
(depth 9, wd 5e-4) - so much so that it went from breaking the functional form
to making it steeper! Now, the actual *research* part consists of 
understanding why it's [not] working, and fixing it when it's broken. Pulling
these threads is what allows a highly productive researcher at OpenAI to
identify and eliminate any irregularities, ensuring stability in results,
thereby producing a highly predictive functional form.

The answer lies in the learning curves of the variant trials. We must plot
the experiment in wandb (possibly including telemetry i.e. gradient norms), 
and analyze the results to understand the cause of variation. In doing so, we
can systematically construct a model with good scaling laws in addition to
simply executing the research well.
